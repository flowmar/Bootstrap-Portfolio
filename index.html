				Hello! My name is Omar, welcome to my portfolio page! I am 27 years old and live in Houston, TX. My two favorite things to do are to code and to hoop. I started hooping a year and a half ago on my 26th birthday when my friend let me play with her hoop, and I fell in love with every aspect of it. I started a business, <a href="https://kineticvortexflow.com">Kinetic Vortex Flow</a>, we make custom hoops and sell them at festivals and locally. I am currently working on the website for KVF, and it's actually what got me interested in coding in the first place.
			</p>
			<br>

				In the beginning, I was just intending to create a site to sell my hoops, but that began a tumble down the rabbit hole into the world of computers. I love coding; it's like a bunch of little puzzles that you solve in order to create intricate programs that can be used to change lives! I learned programming basics with Python and am currently taking a course in Java and a course in Linux Essentials. I started at the Houston Coding Bootcamp in February and have already learned a LOT and have seen myself grow. In the past I've been very confused about what I want to do with my life...  and I still do not have an answer to that question, but one thing I <em>am</em> sure of is that I want to be in this career field! I'm excited to see where this journey takes me! <br><br>
