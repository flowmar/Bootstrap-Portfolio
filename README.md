## *Concepts: Bootstrap*

---

In this assignment, we were tasked to take our basic portfolios and recreate them using Bootstrap.

## Assignment:


	### Assignment Two Instructions (Bootstrap)

    1. Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

    2. Use Bootstrap CSS to recreate the portfolio you built last week. Your Bootstrap solution should _not_ make explicit use of media queries.

    3. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to Github Pages.

    ### Submitting Your Work on [BootcampSpot.com](http://bootcampspot.com/)

    1. Submit the GitHub links to your portfolio repositories on GitHub.

    2. Submit the link to your (Github Pages) deployed site in the same input field.

    ### BONUS

    * Incorporate CSS animations in your portfolio. [More info here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).
